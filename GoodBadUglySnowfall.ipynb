Even when it does snow, it has not been a significant amount. However, 1 out of the 2 years that data was available for did have a \"White Christmas\" where it snowed on Christmas day. Due to the limited data set, this 50% mark could be very skewed."

        "The new graphs that we have decided to construct are based largely on the original idea. We really wanted to take a look at the concept that it snows on Christmas, and see how often the stereotype is actually correct. We took December 20-29th data from each year and compiled the snowfall for each year. We used blue to indicate snowfall on every day in that range except for December 25th, which we indicated with a red bar. This makes the graph easy to read, and it is very simple to extrapolate the things we wanted to communicate with the graph. It is very easy to see how often a White Christmas actually occurs, and it is also easy to see how often during the holiday season snow is actually present in some way, and what amount of snow is commonplace."

We used the bar graph format to have clearly comparable sizes that show what years had greater snowfall in the period around Christmas. The other variable we chose to use was color. We decided to make each day from December 20-31 the same shade of blue, but we made December 25th data red. In this way, we can also quickly see from the visualization which years had white Christmases, as well as about how often white Christmases have occurred in recent years."

Our retinal variables for this graph were the orientation and the size. There is no clear differentiation in the sizes of the graph which can result in the user misunderstanding the data and coming to a false conclusion. The orientation of the graph is also confusing to the viewer and there is a complete lack to meaning corresponding to the different colors on the graph. All of this will leave a viewer puzzled and unable to take away any real meaning from the graph.   "

The colors of the graph do not convey an meaningful information, and serve only to make the graph more cluttered and difficult to read. Also the orientation of the graph is not very meaningful. There are blocks that are simply floating around, and again do not serve to communicate any meaningful data to the viewer. The graph looks extremely ugly, takes up a lot of space, and it is hard to extrapolate any meaningful data from it."
