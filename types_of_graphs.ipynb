After reading the graph it appears that the win points spiked very high from 1988 to 1995 and then again from 2015 to 2018. The sum lose poits spiked right off the back and alot from 1998 to 2015."

The plots start by going up alittle bit, then gradually fall down, then spike up, then down and are gradually comimg up now, so the graph isn't very consistent. The highest points seemed to be aroun 1989 and the lowest were around 2012 to 2014."

I chose to do a ranking chart with winning team points and games by year.After looking at the graph I noticed that for the most part, the more recent yeras had the most points scored but that not the case for the whole graph because there are several early 2000's and and 90's years that surpass recent years like 2012 and 2011. It goes to show that just because the game is changing that it doesnt always affect how many points are scored in a game."

After looking at the data, most teams seemed to play atleast 1 overtime game and th a maximum number of overtime games played by all these teams was 2. The teams that atually utilized the box plots were the Bonnies, the Bulldogs, The Nittany lions, and The Red Hawks. The data only goes up s many because tehse are the losing teams and once you lose in the tournament you are out."

After studying the graph it appears that at first the losing teasm scored the lowest overall in 1986, then quickly went up, slowlyy went down, then back up, then back down, and are continung to go up for this year. Its an interesting graph to see how the points by the losing team hasn't been on a constant incline or decline since 1986, but recently seems to continue to rise. This goes to show that the offenses in these tournaments are improving."
